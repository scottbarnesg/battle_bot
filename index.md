# Build you own Battle Bot

### Scott Barnes & Chris Poole

School of Engineering & Applied Science


## Introduction
We present a step-by-step process for creating your own remote-controlled battle bot from scratch, covering all hardware and software used in our design. While the goal of our project was to design a battle bot, the electrical design and software we used can applied to other robotic applications. We have done our best to provide comprehensive explanations of our source code and wiring diagrams, and have provided a few unit tests to help you along the way.

All source code can be found in the project's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/scottbarnesg/battle_bot).
